# AdventOfCode2024
This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, written in C. The goal is to deepen my understanding of programming at a low level and improve my problem-solving skills.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event where programmers are presented with a series of coding puzzles from December 1st to 25th. Each puzzle increases in difficulty, offering an excellent opportunity to improve programming skills through practice.

## Repository Structure

* Each day's challenge is organized in its own folder, named DayXX (e.g., Day01, Day02, etc.).
* Each folder contains:
  * A C source file (main.c) with the solution to the day's problem.
  * A README.md file with a brief summary of the problem and any notes on my solution approach.
